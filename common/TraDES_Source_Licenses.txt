TraDES Source Code - top level directory
Hogue Lab, National University of Singapore

2012 - Open-TraDES  Source Code Release.


----------------------------
IMPORTANT LICENSE INFORMATION  The Short version:

Hogue Lab code is free and BSD licensed, but the TraDEs executable build from source code 
requires licenses for other 3rd party modules.

Implications for Academics: 
A) You must agree to all the licenses below.
B) You may re-compile TraDES at no cost - but see point 3 below regarding CodeBase libraries.

Implications for Companies: 
A) You must agree to all the licenses below.
B) The DSSP module has a separately administered commercial license (not us!) 
   You can omit the DSSP module from the build by removing the USE_DSSP compile-time directive
   OR you can use it but you must pay your $1000 Euro and sign up here:
   http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/HTML/license_com.html
C) To re-compile TraDES - see point 3 below regarding CodeBase.

-----------------------------
IMPORTANT LICENSE INFORMATION The Longer Version:

TraDES is legacy C software with several different licenses embedded in various source modules.

The majority of the Hogue Lab code is released in 2012 under the Simplified BSD License.

However there are still dependencies on Third Party (i.e. not us) Academic and Commercial licences.

Where applicable - copyrights are owned by the respective authors and institutions or companies.
Each source code module contains a header indicating its license terms.

In general the source code licenses are:

1. Simplified BSD License 
 - Code arising from Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, National 
   University of Singapore, and Institutional collaborations.

2. Public Domain Notice 
 - Code arising from the U.S. Government - NCBI - National Library of Medicine

3. Commercial License (Software source code distribution is prohibited, therefore not included)
 - CodeBase - Sequiter Software (www.codebase.com)
 - To see the CodeBase source code you must buy it. 
 - However you can compile against the precompiled libraries we provide. 
 - Wow, cool. How?
 - The Hogue Lab owns a Sequiter Software CodeBase licenses for all platforms we compile to.
   We may distribute Executable software and dynamic linkable libraries for runtimes without royalty. 
  -Precompiled Library (MS-DOS *.obj/*.dll or unix *.o/*.so and header) files for CodeBase are provided with headers.
  -You must agree to a sublicense of Sequiter Software (see below) which allows you to link against the libraries,
   provided no changes are made to the CodeBase dependent TraDES modules (*.trj file use) and no
   other new development is undertaken utilizing the CodeBase libraries by writing any new direct calls 
   through the CodeBase headers. Any software modifications you make to TraDES must be indirect with regard to any
   CodeBase functions.
  -Please specify the OS Platform, Version and
   processor architecture when making a precompiled library request for any other platform.

4. Modified Third Party Modules have their own licenses reprinted below:
  -Includes DSSP and BZIP2 
  -Commercial users must separately license DSSP (see below).
  -DSSP can be disabled from the default build by removing the USE_DSSP compiler directive.
 
5. All dependencies within this code on former Thomson-Reuters commercial software products purchased from Mount Sinai 
   Hospital in 2007 including SeqHound (BOND+), BIND (BIND+), BIND-3DBP, BIND-3DSM, 
   and SMID have been removed from this source code release. 

6. Additionally the source code release has removed HomTraj, RPSBlast, MobiDick 
   and Distributed Folding module dependencies, as they are no longer maintained, nor relevant
   to the new primary use of TraDEs as a tool for studying intrinsically disordered proteins.

7. Finally: The TraDEs Patent is no longer enforceable as maintenance payments to the USPTO have never been made.
   See 6490532_Method_to_construct_protein_stru.pdf

CODEBASE SCHEDULE A - Linkable Library Distribution.

These are the terms under which the CodeBase linkable
libraries can be redistributed for TraDES linking.
In this case "you" are the "Sub-Licensee". 
The "Licensee" is the National University of Singapore and/or
Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto.

See www.codebase.com for more details.


SCHEDULE "A"


This Schedule "A" forms part of the Agreement between you, the 
CodeBase Licensee, and Sequiter Software Inc.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO BE IMPOSED UPON THE CodeBase 
Sub-Licensee:

CodeBase Sub-License Agreement

Whereas, the CodeBase Licensee has licensed software from 
Sequiter Software Inc. (Sequiter) under the terms of  the 
CodeBase Software License Agreement.

Whereas, the CodeBase Licensee has certain distribution rights to 
the licensed software provided that this legal agreement is 
imposed upon the CodeBase Sub-Licensee.

Whereas, the CodeBase Licensee has agreed not to directly or 
indirectly distribute software which provides programmatic 
database capabilities and which also uses the Licensed CodeBase 
Software  unless otherwise agreed to by Sequiter.

Whereas, this legal document is an agreement between you, the 
CodeBase Sub-Licensee, and the CodeBase Licensee 
(hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement").


1.Definitions

Licensed Software:  This is the Sequiter computer programs 
contained in the CodeBase software package or any computer 
programs containing parts of the computer programs in the 
package. These programs could be represented in any form:  in 
print, as electronic source code, as compiled object modules, as 
a library file, a dynamic link library, or an executable program.  
It includes the CodeReporter and CodeControls software which is 
bundled with CodeBase.


Executable Software:  This is a form of the Licensed Software 
which can be executed directly by a computer.   Under Microsoft 
Windows the name extension of executable software is typically 
".EXE".


DLL Software:  This is a dynamic link library form of the 
Licensed Software which is executed indirectly under the 
operating system.  It includes dynamic link library forms of the 
Licensed Software.  For the purpose of this license agreement, 
other forms of the Licensed Software which are executed 
indirectly, such as ".VBX" or ".OCX" custom control libraries are 
also considered to be DLL Software.


Server Engine Software:  This is executable software or DLL 
Software which participates in performing remote database 
requests originating from a separate client computer.


Distributable Executable Software:  This is all Executable 
Software except for Server Engine Software.   (Client and 
stand-alone configurations are not Server Engine Software and 
consequently are not excluded from distribution under this 
definition.  Multi-user applications using file based locking are 
also not Server Engine Software.)


Distributable DLL Software:  This is all DLL Software except for 
the Server Engine Software.


Distributable Software:  This is all Distributable Executable 
Software and Distributable DLL Software.


Licensed Operating Systems:  The licensed operating systems are 
listed along with your serial number  label which comes with this 
software package.  You agree to retain this serial number label 
as proof of which operating systems are licensed.  If no 
operating systems are specified on the serial number label, the 
Licensed Operating Systems consist of the DOS and the Microsoft 
Windows operating systems. 


2. Sub-License

You may use the Distributable Software under the Licensed 
Operating Systems with, and only with, application(s) provided by 
the CodeBase Licensee.  You agree not to use the Distributable 
Software for any other purpose.  You agree not to use the 
Distributable Software for the purposes of software development 
and agree to take appropriate measures to ensure that no one uses 
the Distributable Software for the purposes of software 
development without an appropriate separate license.
