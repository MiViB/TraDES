This document requires revision - (Mac BSTDT install instructions)

Codes representing a variety of non-standard, phosphorylated, or post-translationally 
modified amino acids can be entered directly into a FASTA FILE.

For information about entering non-standard amino acids into TraDEs
see the ENCLOSED  file :

TraDES_2\Documentation\SLRIextaa.html


To VISUALIZE non-standard amino acids in Cn3D you must substitute the file
bstdt.val from the TraDES Package and overwrite the smaller bstdt.val file
that comes with Cn3D located here on Windows.


C:\Program Files (x86)\NCBI\Cn3D\Cn3D 4.3\data\bstdt.val


ON the Macintosh, Cn3D is packaged with executables and data files inside
the Apps folder.  

You will have to open up the package and replace bstdt.val inside.
