Compatibility Notes for the TraDES software package
-------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the wide variability in today's computing platforms,
and the complexity of the TraDES software package, we cannot
guarantee that TraDES will function on your specific hardware
or operating system.

Most of the libraries used by the program are statically linked
but some are dynamically linked. 

If you have difficulty on a Unix/Linux based platform you can use 
the command ldd to show the library dependencies each binary program 
requires, like this:

[chogue@localhost misc]$ ldd addcr
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff706e6000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x0000003a99200000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000003a98e00000)

We have provided versions for as many platforms as we are able, 
but some may have certain issues which are discussed here.

If you would like this software built for a system not covered here, 
please e-mail me at

chogue@blueprint.org

and I will do my best to accomodate you.


------------------------------------
32 Bit Linux Builds  

These are built for Pentium 4 and later processors. They may not work on older CPUs.

CentOS5_5_x86 is CentOS 5.5 and compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.5 
- This build contains a working Vistraj
- you may need to resolve any missing Vistraj library dependencies with yum.

Ubuntu10_10_x86 is Ubuntu 10.10 and contains a working Vistraj.
 - you may need to reslove any missing Vistraj library dependencies.

Fedora14_x86 is Fedora 14.  This build does not support Vistraj as OpenMotif is not supported on it yet.

If you need binaries for an older version of Linux - please let us know.

------------------------------------
64 Bit Linux Builds

CentOS5_5_x86_64 is CentOS 5.5 and compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.5 
- This build contains a working Vistraj
- you may need to resolve any missing Vistraj library dependencies with yum.

Fedora14_x86_64 is Fedora 14  
- This build does not support Vistraj as OpenMotif is not supported on it yet.

OpenSUSE11_3_x86_64 is OpenSUSE 11.3 
- This build does not support Vistraj as OpenMotif is not supported on it yet.
- A buggy Vistraj 1.1.2 is provided but we cannot see the sequence line, maybe you can.

If you need binaries for an older version of Linux - please let us know.

------------------------------------
Mac OS X Builds

MacOSX10_4_PPC is Mac OS X 10.4 on PowerPC based Macintosh computers
- is a PPC architecture thin binary
- is capable of running on 10.4-10.6 and on i386 emulation mode - but very slow!
- Vistraj is not supported on this platform

MACOSX10_6_x86 is Mac OS X 10.6 on Intel based Macintosh computers
- is an i386 architecture thin binary
- Vistraj is not supported on this platform
------------------------------------
WindowsXP Builds

This version was compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 on Windows XP
and has only been tested on this platform. 

If you want to run it under Windows 7 note that all the command line utilities work.

- Vistraj 1.1.1 is shipped in the Windows build.  Ignore the broken link to the website and the out of date
contact information for the time being.  It runds best under Windows XP mode.

-------------------------------------
Archival Builds - Original foldtraj binaries for sampling systems:

2003 Builds are available - please write if you need an older distribution on
one of the following circa 2003 architectures:
Solaris on Sparc 32-bit 
QNX in Intel
linux-i386 
linux-i386-icc (Intel Compiler)
linux-ppc (Yellowdog Linux)
linux-hppa (PA-Risc Linux)
linux-ps2 (PS2 Linux - yup...)
macosx  (PPC Mac OS X 10.1)
irix6x  (SGI IRIX 64 bit)
irix6x32 (SGI IRIX 32 bit)
solaris64 (Solaris on Sparc 64-bit)
Compaq (Tru64 Unix on Alpha) 
FreeBSD on Intel 
HPUX (HP PA-RISC systems) 
BeOS on Intel 
Solaris-x86

We can arrange to get you a working foldtraj for these older OS/CPUs. 



General
-------
If you have any problems getting the software to run (i.e. fatal errors, machine
freezes, etc) please check the above list to see if you have access to a machine
with a supported version of the OS installed on it.  When it doubt try Windows,
as this is the least variable of all the platforms listed above.  If you still
experience problems, or would like to obtain a version for a system not listed
above, please contact the authors at:

chogue@blueprint.org

Also, make sure you have the latest version of the software, which is located at:

          ftp://ftp.blueprint.org/pub/TraDES/

and called TraDES-current-XXXXX.tar.gz where XXXXX is your platform name.
